# MeyersBriggMLModel

## Purpose
See if a machine learning model can be created that will predict a person's personality based on their posture. A CSV file contains data with a bunch of people 
and their posture and personality types. 

## Technologies Used
Google Colab, Python, Pandas, ML Algorithms(K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines). Pandas is used to load the data set within Google Colab and then sci-kit learn is used to incoroporate the machine learning algorithms.

## How to use?
Run all the cells in the Google Colab in order to show the results of the workbook. 

## Results
Found a 40 percent correlation with the ML algorithms listed.
